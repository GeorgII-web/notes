# Testing Abstract Classes using Anonymous Classes

### TL;DR

Write the entire [anonymous](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.anonymous.php) class definition on the spot

```php filename="test.php" {1} copy
$anonymousClass = new class () extends AbstractClass {
    public function __construct() {}
};
```

### What is it?

They can pass arguments through to their constructors, extend other classes, implement interfaces, and use traits just like a normal class can

### Example

Abstract base class that contains an unimplemented abstract method.

```php filename="abstractClass.php" {3} copy
abstract class AbstractClass
{
    public abstract function abstractMethod();
}
```

Wrap the abstract method into an anonymous class for execution and testing.

```php filename="test.php" {1} copy
$anonymousClass = new class extends AbstractClass {
    protected function abstractMethod()
    {
        return 'ok';
    }
};

$anonymousClass->abstractMethod();
```
