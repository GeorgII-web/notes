# Testing Abstract Classes using Anonymous Classes

### TL;DR

Write the entire [anonymous](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.anonymous.php) class definition on the spot

```php filename="test.php" {1} copy
$anonymousClass = new class () extends AbstractClass {
    public function __construct() {}
};
```

### What is it?

They can pass arguments through to their constructors, extend other classes, implement interfaces, and use traits just like a normal class can

#### Example

```php filename="abstractClass.php" {9} copy
test
```
