# Retry — Quick Guide

A tiny PHP helper to wrap any callable with a retry algorithm. It helps you handle transient failures (like flaky network or temporary DB issues) by retrying your code a few times before giving up.

Source code: https://github.com/GeorgII-web/Retry

## Basic usage

```php
use GeorgII\Retry;

// Retry on any exception (default settings)
$result = Retry::onAnyException(fn () => someOperation());
```

## With options

```php
use GeorgII\Retry;
use GeorgII\Event\RetryEvent;

$result = Retry::onAnyException(
    attemptCallback: function (RetryEvent $event) {
        return someOperation($event);
    },
    retryCount: 3,      // how many times to retry
    retryDelay: 0.2,    // seconds between attempts (can be a Closure for backoff)
    eventCallback: function (RetryEvent $event) {
        // observe events if you need
        // var_dump($event->getName(), $event->getAttempt());
    }
);
```

## Using your own alias (example)

If you commonly retry specific exceptions, wrap them in an alias in your project and call it directly:

```php
use GeorgII\Retry;

$users = Retry::onDbException(fn () => $sql->query('SELECT * FROM users'));
```

That's it — simple, small, and focused on retriable errors only.
