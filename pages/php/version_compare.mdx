# Version compare

### TL;DR

Use a builtin function from the [manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.version-compare.php)

```php filename="compare.php" {1} copy
version_compare('1.0.1', '1.0.0')
```

### What is it?

Software versioning, typically following the Semantic Versioning system and it involves three components: MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH.

For every new release, one of these components is incremented.

In a practice, it could be useful to check system requirements, like package or PHP version of an environment.
Even more, compatibility of Front- and Back-end could be validated, like, checking the minimum compatible front-end version from a request.

### Example

Checkin minimum PHP version.

```php filename="comapre.php" {4} copy
$version = phpversion();
echo $version . PHP_EOL;
$min_version = "8.2.1";
if (version_compare($version, $min_version) < 0) {
    throw new RuntimeException('You have an old PHP version');
}
```
